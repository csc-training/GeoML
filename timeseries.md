# Dealing with temporal dimension

**This document is a work in progress**

Many considerations on spatial dimension can also be applied to temporal dimension.

Examples:
* Train separate models for each season
* Use timeseries models, like temporalConvolutionalNeuralNetwork, LongShortTermMemory, ...
